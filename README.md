# Machine Failure Prediction Project

## Overview

The Machine Failure Prediction project is a data-driven initiative aimed at predicting and
preventing machinery failures using advanced machine learning techniques. By analyzing
historical data on machine performance, the project seeks to identify patterns and
indicators that precede failures, enabling proactive maintenance measures and minimizing
downtime.

## Background

Machinery breakdowns can lead to costly downtime, maintenance expenses, and disruptions in
production. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data and
other relevant parameters to predict potential failures before they occur. By providing
insights into the health of machines, operators can schedule preventive maintenance,
reducing the risk of unexpected breakdowns.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-failure-prediction.git
   cd machine-failure-prediction

   ```

2. To setup only the necessary dependencies, run the following:

```
poetry install --without dev
```

If you want to use `pre-commit`, install all the dependencies:

```
poetry install
```
